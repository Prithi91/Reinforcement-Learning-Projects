This project attempts to replicate the experiments foundin "Q-Learning" by Amy Greenwald and Keith Hall Greenwald,
Hall, and Serrano 2003, that introduces Correlated-Q (CE-Q)learning, a multiagent Q-learning algorithm based on the correlated equilibrium(CE) solution concept.

A detailed analysis of the experiements, assumptions made and results can be found in Analysis.pdf
