This project developes and trains an agent for solving the ”Lunar Lander- V2” problem found in OpenAI gym. The same agent is also tested for 1000 episodes of Lunar Lander environment and the rewards earned by the agent are analysed.
A detailed analysis of the RL techniques used to train the lander and the effects of tuning various hyper parameters can be found in Analysis.pdf.
